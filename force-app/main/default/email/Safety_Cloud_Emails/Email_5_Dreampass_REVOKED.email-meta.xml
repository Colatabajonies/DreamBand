    <subject>[ACTION REQUIRED]: Your Davos Dreampass has expired</subject>

Hi {!Contact.Name},

To help ensure the health and safety of our in-person attendees, and the community at Davos, we have protocols in place before and during the event.

Because we have not received documentation of your onsite PCR test within 24hrs of check in, your Dreampass has expired.

Action Required: Please stop by the Salesforce Welcome center to get an onsite COVID-19 PCR test. This will re-activate your Dreampass.
The Salesforce Welcome Center is located at: 81 Promenade, Davos Platz
* Monday - Tuesday from 6:30 a.m. - 8:30 p.m. CET
* Wednesday from 6:30 a.m. - 11:59 p.m. CET


Thanks,
Salesforce Davos Team
