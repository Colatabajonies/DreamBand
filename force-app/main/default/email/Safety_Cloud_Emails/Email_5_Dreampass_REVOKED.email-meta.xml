    <textOnly>Hi {!relatedTo.Name},
Safety is our #1 value. As we get together, safely in Davos to inspire, network, and energize everyone with our culture for a fast start to FY23. To ensure the health and safety of our in-person attendees, and the community of Davos, we have protocols in place before and during the event.

It&apos;s time to upload your proof of COVID-19 vaccination including a Booster Shot to Salesforce Safety Cloud. This is an essential step in supporting Safety as our #1 value for this event. Every step you take in our safety protocol goes a long way in keeping everyone safe.
